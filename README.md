District Demographic Impact on Partisan Activity in U.S. Congressional Voting Patterns


This paper explores how constituent demographics impact the ways that congressional house members interact through co-voting patterns represented by a network graph. First the congressmembers interactions between parties are quantified with modularity and assortivity to provide a benchmark to compare against. Then unsupervised learning techniques assign each congressional district to one of three groups based on constituent demographics. The party affiliations of the officials they elected are then revealed to study how the grouped parties interact amongst themselves and then finally against the other groups. This analysis showed the importance of diverse constituent basis to combat congressional gridlock further highlighting the danger that gerrymandering can have on the USâ€™s legislative body.
